### [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) users

If you're using [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen), install this plugin by doing the following:

1. Add `antigen bundle hadenlabs/zsh-ghq` to your `.zshrc` where you're adding your other plugins.
2. Either open a new terminal to force zsh to load the new plugin, or run `antigen bundle hadenlabs/zsh-ghq` in a running zsh session.
3. Enjoy!
